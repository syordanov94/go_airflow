# Go-Airflow Lab

In this repository, we will explore how to interact with Apache Airflow using Go. We will create a simple API using Gin-Go that will interact with an local instance of Apache Aifrflow.

This repository presents an example of a API written in Go that interacts with Apache Airflow and updates variables and DAGs to achieve desired
results.

## Pre-requisites

    - Docker installed
    - Golang 1.22 or higher
    - A knowledge of Apache Airflow DAG creation and management. This includes some knowledge of Python.

## Project Description

We will create an API that creates (and updates) users names for a made up video game. This API will publish those names to Apache Airflow in the form of a variable. This variable will be consumed by an example DAG that will process the scores of the users and update those in some storage system (maybe another variable or a database entry) periodically.

The API will have the following endpoints:

    - POST /users: This endpoint will receive a JSON payload with the user name and will create a new user in the system. This user will be added to the Airflow variable. The JSON payload will look like this:
    ```json
    {
        users: [
            {
                name: "user1"
            },
            {
                name: "user2"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    - GET /users/{userName}/score: This endpoint will return the score of the user with the given name.

## How to run the project

Before starting the API, we need to start the local Airflow instance. To do this we need to run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

Once that is done, we can start the API by running the following command:

    ```bash
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```

The API will be available at <http://localhost:8080>.
